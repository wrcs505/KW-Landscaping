// Outstanding problems:

DATEONLY takes what format? YYYY-MM-DD throws format error

What is wrong with S.ARRAY(S.TEXT/S.STRING)? Both options throw "values.map is not a function"

Should locations and/or dates be individual models to avoid these problems?

What is a more efficient way to seed the associations? ran into callback max of 6

Remaining additions:

Add dynamic functionality for data analysis--average billings per invoice/client/project/month/staff
