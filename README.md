# Wallice Landscaping

Wallice Landscaping is a landscape management company based in the Greenville, South Carolina region. The owner decided he needed to expand his marketing footprint by developing a public-facing website.

Initially favoring an extremely simple and mostly static build, the owner came to realize that a custom database would be a worthwhile investment. The database would not only allow the public-facing website to offer greater dynamic functionality, but more importantly, could serve as a valuable asset for internal tasks ranging from record-keeping to operational and marketing analysis.

Ultimately, the database will serve as the primary repository for all business data, vastly improve record-keeping workflows, drive and manage inbound lead generation, improve customer satisfaction, and create efficiencies that will allow the company to expand quickly and sustainably.

# The Plan

After extensive consultations with the owner, the project was conceived and broken down into several phases to ensure a smooth rollout, while minimizing upfront costs.

* Phase 1:

During the initial phase, I worked with the owner to identify a hierarchy of priorities based on a cost-benefit analysis.

We determined that starting with the database build would be best. The thinking was that we should optimize his existing, internal operations before seeking to add more clients to his workload. Additionally, with tax season looming, there was extra incentive to get his record-keeping in order.

* Phase 2:

The initial database build would be hosted locally, with online backups, and the owner would use free, out-of-the-box software to interact with the database. This was done to minimize both upfront development and hosting costs, and because the owner wanted a trial period with the database during which updates to the schema would be minimally burdensome.

* Phase 3:

Once this was rolled out and the owner was comfortable that the schema was an exact fit for his needs, work would begin on a web-based interface for the database. This would be for internal use--that is, both the owner and his staff would be able to interface with the database seamlessly while in the field. This would be hosted on a sub-domain of what would ultimately be the publicly-facing site.

At this stage, login ability would be enabled for the owner's internal staff and external contractors. Each group would be given certain rights to view internal data relevant to their responsibilities. For example, staff could see information related to theeir assigned projects and equipment, and an accountant could export a live snapshot of transactional info in the database.

* Phase 4:

The next step was adding client-facing functionality via email. The internal site would be able to dispatch emails automatically, containing various types of information from the database, directly to clients. This would serve as a trial rollout for the ultimate public-facing site.

Two options were devised: emails could contain styled HTML with the content directly integrated, or contain individualized, private links to specific content hosted on the internal site's sub-domain. For example, clients could be invoiced and remit payment directly.

* Phase 5:

Once the owner was satisfied with the testing of client-facing functionality, work would begin on the main public-facing site. To minimize costs, this would be primarily template-based, as there are many existing, attractive templates for landscape businesses.

At this stage, login ability would be further rolled out to existing and prospective clients. Existing clients could see repositories of previous work and billing information, while prospective clients could schedule work.

Click-to-call and dynamic scheduling would be enabled.

* Phase 6:

After completion of the public-facing site, inbound marketing operations could be developed. After an analysis of existing competitors' online operations, it was determined the primary means of inbound marketing would be targeted PPC campaigns. Two different customer profiles were developed: home-owners, and enterprises like property management companies and real estate developers. The PPC campaigns would be optimized primarily with automated scripts to minimize ongoing management costs.

# Feature Highlights

* Via model associations, the database will individually manage all clients, projects, work locations, staff, equipment, payable and receivable invoices relationally. For example:

What equipment is assigned to which staff?

Which staff are assigned to which projects?

Which recaivable invoices are related to which clients and projects?

Which payable invoices are related to which projects, materials and equipment?

* Granular record-keeping for tax and legal purposes is extremely important in a cash-intensive service business.

Service providers in the state of South Carolina are responsible for Sales and Use taxes, some of which they originate, and some of which they pass-through. Additionally, claiming all legal write-offs can make a massive difference in the ultimate bottom line.

Keeping track of staff records is also crucial in an industry known for extremely high turnover.

* Analysis of ongoing operations is a crucial, yet frequently overlooked factor. It's in the owner's interest to determine which types of clients and services drive the greatest profitability so that logistical planning and marketing operations can be targeted optimally.

The owner wanted the ability to seamlessly organize content for internal and external consumption. By maintaining a set of detailed internal notes, he would have the ability to add practical context to the data maintained in the database.

Some of the data types chosen for storage and curation include:

What is the average customer lifetime/yearly/monthly value?

What type of client generates the most average billings per invoice/project? Average profit?

What is the average payroll expense per month for a specific staff role?

Which services are most profitable in which months?

Which products are most popular among residents? Enterprises?

Which inbound marketing tactics drive the most conversions? Most profitable conversions?

# Why not Wordpress?

Given the extreme prevalence of Wordpress-based and similar products tailored to small businesses in general and landscapers in particular, why was so much custom functionality worthwhile?

An examination of existing software products determined that they either lacked functionality or necessitated open-ended financial commitments. Further, the possibility that a software vendor could drop support at a future date was extremely concerning. The owner wanted something that he didn't have to license, and that he could rely on indefinitely.

The owner also wanted a highly granular record-keeping interface to encourage proper practices.
